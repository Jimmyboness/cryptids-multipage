# Bootstrap

You've created your Cryptids page. Nice job.

Now it's time to branch out. Literally. Your team will choose one of the Cryptids and build out a page about that Cryptid. You'll do this on a branch. When you're done, you'll make a pull request to merge it back into the master branch.

### Here's what you'll need to do:

1. Your team will choose your Cryptid
2. Sketch & wireframe what your Cryptid's page will look like.
3. Find content about your Cryptid on Wikipedia or other sources online.

### Technical requirements:

* Use a body class to make the nav "active" on your page.
* The first section of your page should be a full-screen image of your Cryptid with its name overlayed on top.
* Include at least 3 additional images of your cryptid
* One of your images should float
* Create a two column list of facts about your Cryptid
* Create an intake form for sightings of your Cryptid. Ask for the time, date, location, and a drop down for whether it was found on land, at sea, or in the air.
